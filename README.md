# TICS_Project_Weather_Analysis
In this repository I explain the motivation of this weather analysis  using different open databases from universities, research centers, etc. in Mexico.


## Objectives.
Weather analysis is key to predicting meteorological phenomena and understanding atmospheric behaviour. This project pretends to analyze databases mainly from universities, research centers and government centers, adding that information into a new database that can improve weather analysis.  

For this we use a python script to collect and analyze databases everyday, storaging, handling, and implementing prediction models using machine learning support. The script will show different plotting configurations with information of interest for the analysis.

## Expected Skills
+ Bash use (scripts, automatization, data consulting, etc.)
+ Python (Connection with a server an data management).
+ Data bases management.
+ Data interpretation.
